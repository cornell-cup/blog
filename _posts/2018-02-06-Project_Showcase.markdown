This year the College of Engineering, planned by Engineering Career Fair Team (ECaFT) hosted an Engineering Project Showcase. The event was an opportunity for project teams, Master of Engineering students, Innovation Teams, and Undergradute researchers to showcase their work to recruiters in town for the career fair. At the event, Cornell Cup Robotics had a display detailing their projects and team. Overall, the event was a great opportunity for Cornell Cup to share its projects to communities and recruiters!
