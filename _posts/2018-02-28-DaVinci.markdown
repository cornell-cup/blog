On February 28th, Da Vinci came to visit the Cornell Cup Robotics Lab! They looked at three of our projects: MiniBot, MagGame and Wall. The demo was a great chance for Cornell Cup Robotics to showcase their projects - Da Vinci was pleased with our progress and are excited about our efforts!

Here are some pictures from Da Vinci's visit to our lab.
