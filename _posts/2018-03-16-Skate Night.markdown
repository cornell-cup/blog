As part of a bonding activity, Cornell Cup Robotics hosted a "Cups on Skates" night at Lynah Rink on Friday, March 16th. The organization rented out the entire rink for several hours giving members the opportunity to meet each other and have fun. A lot of the members showed up and afterwards a subset of the group went to Plum Tree. Below are some pictures from the night!
